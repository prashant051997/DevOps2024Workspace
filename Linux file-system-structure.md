# Linux File System Structure

In Linux, the file system is organized in a hierarchical tree structure starting from the root (`/`). Here are some common directories you'll encounter:

- `/`: The root directory, everything begins here.
- `/home`: Contains user home directories.
  - Example: `/home/user` contains the personal files of the user `user`.
- `/etc`: Configuration files for the system and applications.
- `/var`: Variable data like logs and temporary files.
- `/tmp`: Temporary files that can be deleted on reboot.
- `/bin`: Essential binary files (executables) for basic system operation.
- `/lib`: System libraries required for binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- `/dev`: Device files representing hardware devices (like hard drives, printers, etc.).
- `/media`: Mount points for removable media like USB drives or CDs.
- `/mnt`: Temporary mount point for file systems (used by system administrators).
